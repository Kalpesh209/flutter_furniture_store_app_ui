# flutter_furniture_store_app_ui

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project has a "main.dart" as a starting point for a Flutter application.



This app can be used for furniture stores as their e-commerce app. 
The design of this app is so elegant and neat clean and gives the best user experience to the user. We have also added #Flutter #Animation in this design which improvises the overall experience. Go through the code of this #FurnitureApp and I am sure it will help you to learn a lot.

On our Furniture app, #UI has three pages one for the 


1. HomePageScreen which has tabs for different categories then a list of our products in each category. 
2. The ArmChairsScreen is for a particular category page
3. ProductDetailsScreen is for the product page.
